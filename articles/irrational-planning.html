Rational Planning should be called Irrational Planning.
This is because the planners do not have any objective feedback mechanism (like a price system).

I buy a plot of 640 acres north of Houston for 100 million dollars, and create Rogers Forest.
I layout where the Shops and Houses should be, based on a set of rules of thumb on traffic and economics.
I build the infistructure using a MUD.
I make tons of money if I do well, and go bankrupt if I do not.

I am in charge of Portland Metro.
I blow money on stuff, because the taxpayer has my back.
I do not know or care about doing a good job because there is no profit motive.
