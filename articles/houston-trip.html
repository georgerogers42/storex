  I just went to Houston the shining city on the plain.
  A polite city of hustle, heart, wealth, and power (thanks to it's dominance of the energy industry.)
  Houston while being a top notch global city has an ease to it lacking in Chicago even in the suburbs where I live.
  I stayed at an airbnb in Tanglewood.

  I couldn't beleve the array of small buisnesses in Houston.
  Most places are dominated by chains to a much greater extent than Houston.
