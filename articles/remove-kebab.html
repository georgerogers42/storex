In Bosanska Krajina, at the foot of Mount Kozara
podig'o the Serbian people are defending their homes

Hear the gang Islamic mujahedin
You will reach our hand and in Ankara

Of dying for the freedom of every one of us,
our sons will never be slaves

Hear the gang Islamic mujahedin
You will reach our hand and in Ankara

From the German capital Krauts threaten us,
Krajišnici dod'te they say if you dare

Hear the gang Islamic mujahedin
You will reach our hand and in Ankara

Hey gentlemen from Europe and around the world
Serbian people why you are against it now

Hear the gang Islamic mujahedin
You will reach our hand and in Ankara
