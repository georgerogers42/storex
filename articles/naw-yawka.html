New York City an ugly city full of ugly arrogant retarded mental midgets that read Gawker (and treat it as real news), live in a 500 sqft shithole and think they're smart&mdash;but you all are arrogant fools ("Y'all" and "you all" are better than any other form of plural you&mdash;only arrogant self-righteous scumbags that think "you guys" is better).
One that thinks because I live in New York that I can tell everyone else how to live.
Oh I would actually want to live in a 500 sqft shithole&mdash;thanks a lot.

One would think someone who prides themselves on "tolerance" would not say in response to finding out someone's from Texas: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Must be difficult dealing with inbred morons".
"Same to you, arrogant vulgar inbred asshole.  Have you ever heard: Don't speak ill about a place to someone face, you arrogant fool&mdash;Especially if you haven't even been there! And we make more money than you, maggot!" is my reply.

Knowing nothing about anything, but thinking they know everything about anything; is the definition of a fool&mdash;New Yorkers fit the bill perfectly.
Stay in New York and pay through the nose in taxes for all I care.
