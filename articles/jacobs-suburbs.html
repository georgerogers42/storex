<p>
The rules of form for great cities have changed with the mass adoption of automobiles.
The planners are looking back towords an utopian vision of the past that has never existed.
The ugly chaos of sprawl is better than the false cleanlyness of planning.

Saying a place is bad because they are taught that a place is bad.
A bad place always bears bad fruit.
